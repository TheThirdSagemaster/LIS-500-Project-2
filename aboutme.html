        <h2>Student & Wannabe Librarian</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm currently purusing my Master's in Library Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, planning on pursuing a degree in archival work. When not studying and I live and work on my family's small cattle ranch in rural Minnesota. I have an avid interest (and a degree!) in history, as well as philosophy, theology, and political theory, and enjoy reading books, writing fictional stories and creating settings for fantasy worlds, creating maps of alternate history timelines, and nerding out on fantasy series like <i>The Witcher</i> or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>
