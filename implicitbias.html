    <h1>Implicit Bias Resources</h1>
        <!-- Maybe make this its own specific little section like the others below? -->
    <p>This is a resource page for implicit bias. What is implicit bias? Essentially implicit bias are biases one might unknowingly has about another group. More properly, implicit biases is <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/implicit-bias">defined by the American Psychological Association (APA)</a>as a negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group...thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender."</p>
    
    <p>Below are some links and resources that I hope are helpful for explaining implicit biases as well as other related terms and concepts!</p>

    <h2>Implicit Bias Theory</h2>
    <p>Implicit Biased Theory, or IBT, is a theory that explains how our brains categorize people based on overlapping social identities like race, gender, and class. IBT suggests that our brains often hold a "prototype" for certain categories. For example, if a person's implicit prototype for "Black person" is a man, and their prototype for "woman" is a white person, then Black women can face a unique form of "intersectional invisibility." Their specific experiences with bias may be ignored because they don't fit the "standard" prototype of either group.</p> 
    
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://u.osu.edu/breakingbias/related-resources/">State of the Science: Implicit Bias Review</a> – An annual report that summarizes the latest academic research on IBT and how it applies to the real world. (The Kirwan Institute has many other great resources)</li>

        <!-- Intersectionality -->    
    
    <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
    <p>Intersectionality was coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw as a way to understand how different factors in a person's life, such as race, class, ethnicity, etc. influence their life and experience, often in relation to social inequality and injustice. For example, a White male will have a different experience and expectations living in America than a Black male, and  Black male will have a different experience than a Black woman, etc.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> <a href=https://youtu.be/akOe5-UsQ2o>The Urgency of Intersectionality</a> - TedTalk by Kimberlé Crenshaw where she explains why looking at race or gender in isolation misses the "intersection" where many people (especially Black women) fall through the cracks.</li>
