    <h1>Rediet Abebe</h1>
        <p>Rediet Abebe is a computer scientist whose work focuses at the intersection of high-level mathematics and social justice. Born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, she moved to the United States for her studies and eventually became the first Black woman to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University. Today, she is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        
        <p>Dr. Abebe challenges the idea of the "neutrality" of math, arguing instead that if an algorithm is designed without considering socioeconomic reality, it actively scales inequality. Instead of building tech for profit, she argues for Mechanism Design (a field of economics and game theory) to help in issues such as health equity, economic stability and access to opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>She co-founded <a href="https://www.blackinai.org/">Black in AI</a>, a global network that has transformed the landscape for Black researchers in a field where they are severely underrepresented. She also co-founded <a href="https://md4sg.com/">MD4SG (Mechanism Design for Social Good)</a>, an interdisciplinary collective that brings together researchers from over 100 institutions to tackle societal challenges using technical tools.</p>
